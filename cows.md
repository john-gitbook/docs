# Cows

Cattle (_Bos taurus_) are large, [domesticated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication), [bovid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovidae) [ungulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungulates) widely kept as [livestock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock). They are prominent modern members of the subfamily [Bovinae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae) and the most widespread species of the genus [_Bos_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bos). Mature [female](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female) cattle are called cows and mature [male](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male) cattle are [bulls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull). Young female cattle are called heifers, young male cattle are [oxen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxen) or bullocks, and castrated male cattle are known as steers.

Cattle are commonly [raised for meat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef\_cattle), [for dairy products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy\_cattle), and for [leather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather). As [draft animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft\_animal), they pull [carts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cart) and [farm implements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_agricultural\_machinery). In [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India), cattle are [sacred animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal\_worship). Small breeds such as the [miniature Zebu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature\_Zebu) are kept as [pets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet).

Taurine cattle are widely distributed across Europe and temperate areas of Asia, the Americas, and Australia. [Zebus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebu) are found mainly in India and tropical areas of Asia, America, and Australia. [Sanga cattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanga\_cattle) are found primarily in [sub-Saharan Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan\_Africa). These types, sometimes classified as separate species or subspecies, are further divided into [over 1,000 recognized breeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_cattle\_breeds).

Around 10,500 years ago, taurine cattle were domesticated from wild [aurochs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurochs) progenitors in [central Anatolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central\_Anatolia\_Region), the [Levant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant) and [Western Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western\_Iran). A separate domestication event occurred in the [Indian subcontinent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian\_subcontinent), which gave rise to zebu. There were over 940 million cattle in the world in 2022. Cattle are responsible for over 7% of global [greenhouse gas emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse\_gas\_emissions). Cattle were one of the first domesticated animals to have [a fully-mapped genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine\_genome).
